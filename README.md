## Project Description ## 

Here, I have explored and quantified data about music and drawn valuable insights.

Conducted data cleaning to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the Spotify dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn).

Data analysis - Exploring the relationship between the audio features of a song and how positive or negative its lyrics are, involving sentiment analysis and many more.

Spotify Data Analysis makes use of secondary data from Spotify . Use data to identify patterns and relationships between different characteristics. The activity will support in developing ability to review and interpret a dataset.
