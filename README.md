## Project Description ## 

This analysis can be used to demonstrate how music have been translated throughout the past decades. Explored data about music and drawn valuable insights. Conducted data cleaning to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the dataset using Python. Did analysis on data exploring the relationship between the variables, analysing in-depth statistics data and many more. Spotify Data Analysis makes use data to identify patterns and relationships between different characteristics.
